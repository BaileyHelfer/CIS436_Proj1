# Two-Dice Pig
A basic dice game for two players.

## Rules
- If a player rolls a single 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If a player rolls two 1s, their total score is lost and their turn ends.
- If a player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and their turn continues.
- If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their score and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If a double (both dice have the same face value, but not 1s) is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as normal, but the player is - obligated to roll again. This means that the player cannot choose to hold for the next roll, i.e., the hold option is disabled.
- The first player to reach a score of 50 wins the game.
